\section{Overview}
Based on observation and surveys we would recommend the “Speedboat” and “Happy/Sad/Angry” games especially for teams with communication and creativity issues. This approach allows team members which are not that open and talkative to also participate in retrospective. Using standard procedures mostly extrovert people are taking control over this meeting, what makes the introvert part of the team less appreciated and may cause a feeling of not belonging which makes hard for the team to integrate and lowers morale of the less talkative and open team members. This method also increases the creativity by changing the point of view. Team members are asked to answer three questions “what may cause a crash of our project? what pushes us forward and is good for the project? and what improvements should we introduce to sprints so nothing would slow us down?” by answering on them and looking on the project differently we were able to retrieve more ideas. What is more, after the sticky notes are on the board we are able to establish the mood of the team.
On the other hand “Circle” game also increases communicability and creativity, but do not show teams’ mood, we are able to establish what to do in the next iteration (start, stop, continue) and which actions should be reproduced or reduced (less of, more of), but the general mood is being hidden.
