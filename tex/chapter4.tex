\chapter{Games deployment}
We deployed the games presented in chapter 3 in teams working on Intel Technology Poland projects, in Gdansk. The experiment was executed on three different teams, which are presented in \autoref{tab:groups-desc}, they differed in terms of members quantity, team maturity and whole group experience in scrum. 


\begin{table}[!htbp]
	\caption{Groups}
	\label{tab:groups-desc}
	\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|X|X|X|X|}
	\hline
		Group & Number of members & Project Age & Scrum experience \\ \hline
		A & 9 & Extremely mature (1.5 years old project) & typically 2 years  \\ \hline
		B & 3 & Immature (2 months old project) & at least 3 years  \\ \hline
		C & 8 & Mature (7 months old project) & at least 3 years \\ \hline
	\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

The process of deploying a game in a team was as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Describe a particular game to the team
    \item Conduct the game with the team (as a team member or an a coach)
    \item Collect the data and discuss the results with the team
    \item Collect feedback from each team member which participated in a game
\end{itemize}

Each team was asked for a feedback after game deployment, two different sets of questions were asked. After first iteration of deploying two games, \nameref{subch:starfishGame} and \nameref{subch:speedboatGame}, we reflected on the results, the study group and supervisor, using research methodology, Action Research. We evaluated that the retrieved results should be improved, in order to retrieve more interesting and less generic characteristics. First set was as presented below:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item How you evaluate influence of this method on results?
	\item Did the discussions were successful?
	\item Did any unique features were retrieved thanks to the game?
	\item Do employees more willingly participate in the project when work is supported with this kind of game?
	\item How do you evaluate work associated with games comparing to standard procedures?
	\item Were the results better using games instead of standard procedures?	
	\item Would you implement that game permanently instead of standard procedures?
	\item How would you evaluate preparation of the game?
\end{enumerate}
The scale was 1-5, where 5-meant great, excellent and 1 meant bad, not satisfying. 

The \autoref{tab:groups-nPlaysOldSet} presents the quantity of feedbacks retrieved, while playing Speedboat and Starfish Games, in each team, where the games were deployed. By the time, when first iteration was being deployed, team C was not cooperating with us.
\newline


\begin{table}[!htbp]
	\caption{Number of feedbacks using old set of questions}
	\label{tab:groups-nPlaysOldSet}
	\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|X|X|X|}
	\hline
		Group & \# of plays Speedboat & \# of plays Starfish \\ \hline
		Team A & 1 & 1  \\ \hline
		Team B & 1 & 1 \\ \hline
		Team C & 0 & 0 \\ \hline
	\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

The second set was improved in few different aspects, firstly and most importantly the questions in the new set are more specific and are focusing on not the general feeling of the team, but on the concrete problems. Secondly, members were asked to answer questions about specific characteristics, which are supposed to help team develop and improve, such as communication, motivation and creativity. Lastly, the questions were more clear and easy to understand, than the old set and also were presented as statement on which the respondent was suppose to answer how much does he or she agree on it.
The second set was as presented below:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The influence of this method is greater than using standard procedures.
    \item The game should be implemented permanently instead of standard procedures.
    \item The game might complement standard procedures.
    \item Thanks to the game the creativity of team members increased in the retrospective meeting.
    \item Thanks to the game the involvement of team members increased in the retrospective meeting.
    \item Thanks to the game the communication in the team increased in the retrospective meeting.
    \item Thanks to the game the motivation of team members increased in the retrospective meeting.
    \item The game is easy to understand and play.
\end{enumerate}
Similarly as in the first set, the scale was 1-5, if we project the answers on numbers, but the participants of the experiments had five possible options to choose:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Totally disagree.
    \item Disagree
    \item Hard to say.
    \item Agree.
    \item Totally agree.
\end{enumerate}

The \autoref{tab:groups-nPlaysOldSet} presents the quantity of feedbacks retrieved from the teams, while playing the games listed in the sections \ref{subch:speedboatGame},\ref{subch:gmsGame}, \ref{subch:starfishGame}, \ref{subch:moodGame} and \ref{subch:5LGame}.

\section{First iteration}
\label{sec:firstIt}
\subsection{Speedboat Game deployment}
The game was implemented in a scrum team A. While we deployed the game, the team was ending its 31st sprint and was highly integrated. The estimated time of the game was 45 minutes, but the actual turned out to be 1 hour and 30 minutes, because of surprising discussions which was partly caused by the game. The results of retrospective are presented on the \autoref{tab:groups-speedTeamResults} and were quite impressive and the team was able to retrieve 10 things that push them forward, 2 things that could have been done better and 4 “bad things”. Most of the team members were willing to participate in discussion and the result was discovering new issues, new points of view and solutions.
The second group on which we tested Speedboat implementation was team B (group of 3 people), which, by the time, was new and had theirs first iteration and retrospective together. The estimated time of the game for this group was 1 hour, by the end the team was able to retrieve 14 things that push them forward, 7 things which pulls them down and 4 things on which they may crush. The team integrated by sharing thoughts with each other and all of the team members were willing to discuss, constructively argue in some cases. They were asked the same questions as group A and the result were satisfying. 

\begin{table}[!htbp]
	\caption{Results of the Speedboat Game}
	\label{tab:groups-speedTeamResults}
	\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|X|X|X|X|X|X|}
	\hline
		Group & Good Things & Bad Things & Things to improve & Time & Comment\\ \hline
		Team A & 10 & 2 & 4 & 1 hour 30 minutes & 31st iteration \\ \hline
		Team B & 14 & 7 & 4 & 45 minutes & 1st iteration\\ \hline
        Team C & N/A & N/A & N/A & N/A & N/A\\ \hline
	\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

The chart on the \autoref{fig:speedboatResultsOld} represents collected results of this survey using old set of questions.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
\caption{Results of deploying speedboat game using old set of questions}
\label{fig:speedboatResultsOld}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{charts/speedboatOldSet}
\end{figure}

As we can see on the \autoref{fig:speedboatResultsOld} the results are quite similar to each other and also the question "How would you evaluate preparation of the game?" was excluded from the chart, because in case of this study it does not give any interesting characteristics. In this case we are unable to actually retrieve any information, what we know is that the participants of the experiment agree on that the game has better results than the standard procedure. What is more, they think that discussions were successful, employees willingly played the game, work associated with the game has positive impact on the team members and most importantly they would strongly recommend to permanently implement the game instead of standard procedure. On the other hand they decided that it is rather hard to say, if they actually retrieved thanks to the "Speedboat" game any unique features.

\subsection{Starfish Game deployment}

"Starfish" game was also implemented using old set of questions in team A (while they were evaluating theirs 32nd iteration) and in team B (evaluation of 2nd iteration). The results for both teams are presented on \autoref{tab:groups-starTeamResults} and the first team using this game was able to retrieve 8 things that should be started in order to make the iteration successful and ease the work, 1 thing that they should be immediately stop doing, 4 things that they want to continue doing, because they are verified and good for the team and project, they also found 4 things that should be made less and 3 things they want to make more. Team B retrieved 5 "start doing", 2 "stop doing", 2 "continue", 4 "less of" and 6 "more of". The game changed the perspective, so the participants were more creative and interested in a game.

\begin{table}[!htbp]
	\caption{Results of the Starfish Game}
	\label{tab:groups-starTeamResults}
	\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|}
	\hline
		Group & Start doing & Stop doing & Continue & Less of &  Stop doing & Time & Comment\\ \hline
		Team A & 8 & 1 & 4 & 4 & 3 & 1 hour 45 minutes & 32nd iteration \\ \hline
		Team B & 5 & 2 & 2 & 4 & 6 & 1 hour 10 minutes & 2nd iteration \\ \hline
        Team C & N/A & N/A & N/A & N/A & N/A & N/A & N/A\\ \hline
	\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{charts/starfishOldSet}
\end{figure}

\autoref{fig:starfishResultsOld} presents results of the "Starfish" deployment. As we can see, similarly like in "Speedboat" game results using old question set, it hard to retrieve useful data from this chart. The uniqueness of the features is hard to establish like in "Speedboat" deployment and the other results are more or less the same. 

\subsection{Comparison}
The chart on \autoref{fig:comparedResultsOld} presents comparison of deploying "Speedboat" and "Starfish" game, we can see that results does not differ that much, this was the catalyst of actually changing the set of questions to retrieve more valuable characteristics, ask more specifically to retrieve better features.

\section{Second iteration}
\label{sec:secondIt}
\subsection{Speedboat Game deployment}

This test was deployed multiple times on every team that has been listed in \autoref{tab:groups-desc}. Using this game we are able to see that the change of perspective, not using standard procedures, looking at things differently, what will push our boat forward, what might crush us and what is pulling us down the teams more involved, motivated and eager to participate in retrospective game. The \autoref{tab-groups-speedTeamResultsN} presents the results that were retrieved using Speedboat technique of performing retrospective.  in group B one time for 45 minutes and in team C ones for 50 minutes. While team A was in theirs 33rd iteration they were able to find 8 good things, 5 bad things and 3 to improve, two iterations later the results were as follows: 16 good things, 3 bad things and 4 things to improve and they played the game for 1 hour and 15 minutes on average. Team B played the game just once, while having a 3rd iteration and it took them 45 minutes to successfully get 8 good things, 5 bad things and 6 things that needed improvement. The last team, team C, played the game once for 55 minutes and they retrieved 17 good things, 8 bad things and 5 things to improve, while having theirs 19th iteration.

\begin{table}[!htbp]
	\caption{Results of the Speedboat Game}
	\label{tab:groups-speedTeamResultsN}
	\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|X|X|X|X|X|X|}
	\hline
		Group & Good Things & Bad Things & Things to improve & Time & Comment\\ \hline
		Team A & 8 & 5 & 3 & 1 hour 20 minutes & 33rd iteration \\ \hline
		Team A & 16 & 3 & 4 & 1 hour 10 minutes & 35th iteration\\ \hline
		Team B & 8 & 5 & 6 & 45 minutes & 3rd iteration\\ \hline
        Team C & 17 & 8 & 5 & 50 minutes & 19th iteration\\ \hline
	\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

The \autoref{fig:speedboatLive} presents "Speedboat" game deployment. Every single game described in this chapter was documented with a picture and the feedback from the team.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]

\caption{Results of deploying speedboat game using new set of questions}
\label{fig:speedboatResultsNew}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{charts/speedboatNewSet}
\end{figure}

Analysing the results from \autoref{fig:speedboatResultsNew}, we are able to retrieve that the team is seeing better influence on the retrospective meeting using this game, but surprisingly it was hard for them to decide whether they would like to play this game permanently during the next meetings. The probable cause is that the game is fun and good to know, but it should not be used on every retrospective, because of monotony, which we would like to dispose. They could not also decide definitely, but were more convinced than in the previous question, that this game might complement standard procedures. In case of characteristics they were almost definitely convinced that they agree on statements about motivation and involvement of participants while playing "Speedboat", a little bit less they thought that communication increased and they were not convinced in case of team members creativity. What is more and what is actually surprising they could not decide positively in case of ease of understanding the game. 
\subsection{Starfish Game deployment}

"Starfish" game was a big surprise for all the teams, the drastic change of perspective, five fields to fill created multiple discussions. The game was implemented in teams A, B and C, none of the participants known this game before, so because of the complexity the preparation of the game, explaining the rules and giving the participants the time to familiarize with the new approach, made the meeting much longer. The data presented on \autoref{tab:groups-starTeamResultsN} shows the results retrieved by the teams in the retrospective meeting using the described in this subsection. In average team A finished the meeting after 1 hour and 45minutes, they played the game after theirs 36th iteration and the game resulted with 9 things that they should start doing, 3 stop doing, 3 continue, they should do less 5 things and more 2. The team B was in theirs 4th iteration and finished the game in 45minutes, they attained 6 things that may increase their effectiveness and are good for the team, so they should start doing them, 1 that is stopping them and they should dispose it, 7 things that are being already done in the team and they want to continue performing them, 6 things that the team should do less and 1 thing that should be done more often. While having 21st iteration, team C retrieved 6 start doing things, 4 stop doing, 2 continue, 3 less of and 2 more of, the game lingered for 1hour and 10 minutes for them. It was an interesting experience to work with teams which are so involved in the retrospective meeting.

	\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|}
	\hline
		Group & Start doing & Stop doing & Continue & Less of &  More of & Time & Comment\\ \hline
		Team A & 9 & 3 & 3 & 5 & 2 & 1 hour 45 minutes & 36th iteration \\ \hline
		Team B & 6 & 1 & 7 & 6 & 1 & 45 minutes & 4th iteration\\ \hline
        Team C & 6 & 4 & 2 & 3 & 2 & 1 hour 10 minutes & 21st iteration\\ \hline
	\end{tabularx}

\end{figure}


The results in \autoref{fig:starfishResultsNew} represent the feedback retrieved upon "Starfish" game from the team members of all the listed in \autoref{tab:groups-desc} groups. The participants decided that they agree that the game should be permamently implemented in retrospective meetings, what is more based on their opinion the results using this approach is greater than standard procedures. In case of ease of the game, after preparation and discussing the rules, they decided that even though the game is complex, after proper introduction, they understood it clearly. Greater part of participants answered that involvement is a characteristic that could be retrieved from "Starfish". Motivation and creativity in case of this game are the features that can also be increased using this approach, probably because of the innovation of this game, increased using this approach. The groups would rather use this game permanently than as a supplement of standard procedures. Most of the team members were not convinced in case of communication, whether it was actually improved.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Glad/Mad/Sad Game deployment}

Glad/Mad/Sad also known as Happy/Sad/Angry game, was deployed in groups B and C, because internal changes the cooperation with team A was not possible anymore. The Glad/Mad/Sad was not a surprise for the teams, this approach is very similar to the standard one, at the same time, if you have a choice, it is better to use the Glad/Mad/Sad technique rather than the standard Good Things, Bad Things, Things to Improve technique to diversify the retrospective meeting. Both teams played once having theirs 5th iteration, team B and 20th iteration, team C and they approximately for 45 minutes. The \autoref{tab:groups-gmsResultsN} shows the results which were retrieve by the teams. The team A was able to get 8 good things, 7 bad things and 2 to improve and team C respectively 10, 9 and 14.

\begin{table}[!htbp]
	\caption{Results of the Glad, Mad, Sad Game}
	\label{tab:groups-gmsResultsN}

		Group & Good Things & Bad Things & Things to improve & Time & Comment\\ \hline
		Team A & N/A & N/A & N/A & N/A & N/A\\ \hline
		Team B & 8 & 7 & 2 & 40 minutes & 5th iteration\\ \hline
        Team C & 10 & 9 & 14 & 50 minutes & 20th iteration\\ \hline
	\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

On the \autoref{fig:hsaLive} we can see deployment of the "Glad, Mad, Sad" Game in Intel Technology Poland site in Gdańsk.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]

\end{figure}

The \autoref{fig:gmsResultsNew} presents the results of the Glad/Mad/Sad game deployment. The highest result was retrieved in third and eight question and indicates that participants agree on the fact that this technique might complement standard procedures and is easy to understand. The members of the experiment also are rather convinced that the game is increasing the creativity of the team, which proves a previously presented thesis that it is better to use the Glad/Mad/Sad approach, rather than the standard technique. In case of the influence of this method on better results, whether the game should be implemented permanently and team members involvement in the retrospective meeting the participants claimed that it is hard do decide whether, in those fields, any influence exists. The attendees of the experiments agree on the fact that communication and motivation of team members is not influenced by this technique.    

\begin{figure}[!htbp]

\subsection{Mood and improvements Game deployment}
On the \autoref{fig:moodLive} is presented deployment of the "Mood and improvements" game that has been created in collaboration with Intel Technology Teams, merging "Glad, Mad, Sad" game and two fields to indicate ideas for improvements and appreciations for team members. 

\begin{figure}[!htbp]

\end{figure}

The \autoref{tab:groups-moodTeamResultsN} shows the results of Mood and Improvements Game implementation. The team B played the game twice for 45 minutes on average and retrieved in the 6th iteration 6 good things, 3 bad, 6 to improve, they had 3 ideas for improvement and 4 appreciations. In the 9th sprint they found 13 good things, 2 bad things, 2 things that need improvement, 3 ideas for the improvement and 1 appreciations. The second team that participated in the research was team C and in their 22nd iteration they were able to get 12 good things, 16 bad things, 4 things to improve, 4 ideas for enhancement and 1 appreciation, it took them 50 minutes to finish the game.

\begin{table}[!htbp]

		Team C & 12 & 16 & 4 & 4 & 1 & 50 minutes & 22nd iteration\\ \hline
	\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

The \autoref{fig:moodResultsNew} presents the results of feedback received from the participants. The chart indicates that the game was easy to understand and might complement standard procedures. The participants also agreed on the fact that the game increases creativity, communication and involvement, what is more they agree on games better influence on the results comparing to standard procedures and are willing to permanently implement it into the retrospective meeting. The only characteristic that attendants of the experiment cannot decide on is, if the technique increases motivation.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]

\subsection{5L's Game deployment}
The "5L: Liked, Learned, Lacked, Longed for, Loathed" has been created in collaboration with Intel Technology Poland teams, using as a archetype game "4 L's". This approach changes the perspective, shows the participants a different point of view and enables them to learn more about other team members, for example what they learned in the past iteration or what was actually important for them what was done, but they have an idea to improve the current technique used in the project. There are two ways of playing the game that were deployed in the teams. The first one is shown on the \autoref{fig:5lLive}, the areas are arranged in the circle.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
\caption{5 L's game deployment}
\label{fig:5lLive}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{live/5lLive}
\end{figure}
The second one is presented on \autoref{fig:5lLive2} and in this approach we arranged the fields in columns, what is more we assigned sticky-notes colors to particular area, this way we were able to see a clearer picture, where the most features are condensed. 
\begin{figure}[!htbp]
\caption{5 L's game deployment different representation}
\label{fig:5lLive2}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{live/5lLive2}
\end{figure}

Using the 5L's game the participants were involved in the retrospective meeting and especially using the technique with colors they even started to be competitive, who has more pink sticky-notes, or in some cases who has the most diverse pile of papers. In both teams, B and C, the game was deployed twice and was played, responsively for 50 and 65 minutes on average, as presented on \autoref{tab:groups-5LTeamResultsN}. Team B retrieved after finishing their 7th iteration 18 things they liked, 4 learned, 2 lacked, 2 longed for and 6 they loathed, and upon the 8th iteration they discovered 8 likes, 6 learns, 7 lacks, 3 things that they longed for and 8 that they loathed. In contrast, team C retrieved 15 things they liked, 4 learned, 3 lacked, 7 longed for and 10 loathing in the 24th iteration and respectively 14, 4, 2, 5 and 6 in 25th iteration. 

\begin{table}[!htbp]
	\caption{Results of the 5L's Game}
	\label{tab:groups-5LTeamResultsN}
	\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|}
	\hline
		Group & Liked & Learned & Lacked & Longed for & Loathing & Time & Comment\\ \hline
		Team A &  N/A & N/A & N/A &  N/A & N/A & N/A & N/A \\ \hline
		Team B & 18 & 4 & 2 & 2 & 6 & 55 minutes & 7th iteration\\ \hline
        Team B & 8 & 6 & 7 & 3 & 8 & 45 minutes & 8th iteration\\ \hline
        Team C & 15 & 4 & 3 & 7 & 10 & 50 minutes & 24th iteration\\ \hline
        Team C & 14 & 4 & 2 & 5 & 6 & 1hour 20 minutes & 25th iteration\\ \hline
	\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

The \autoref{fig:5lResultsNew} presents the results retrieved from the participants' feedback. The results were positively surprising, because all the bars are equal or above the "Agree" statement. The participants feel the most that the involvement was increased by this technique, what is more they also agree on the fact that communication and motivation was improved by this technique and also they think this game should complement standard procedure in the retrospective meeting. The lowest result, but still very high, because exactly equal to "Agree" statement, the participants gave to the statement about whether 5L's method influence is better than using standard approach, they would also permanently implement the 5L's to the retrospective meeting, moreover they discovered increase in creativity and think that the game is easy to understand.

\subsection{All Deployed Games Comparison}

Described in sections \nameref{sec:secondIt} games were deployed in Intel Technology Poland site in Gdańsk with collaboration with teams listed in \autoref{tab:groups-desc}. Thanks to them two games were created or improved. Moreover we were cooperating with Certified Scrum Master, Grzegorz Regliński, who also helped us in order to properly implement the games in the teams. 

\begin{figure}[!htbp]

\end{figure}

The overall description of deployment is presented on \autoref{fig:overallTimeline}. The figure points out, when in time the particular game were introduced, what is more in which team, while which sprint or whether it was first or second iteration of the question set.
To summarize the chart, each category responds to described games and what is more:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The influence of this method is greater than using standard procedures.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The participants agreed that games: Speedboat, 5L's and Starfish impacts positively on the results. \item Not as strongly, but still closer to "Agree" statement, they think that Mood and Improvements influences the outcome of retrospective comparing to standard procedures.
        \item It is hard for the members of the experiment to decide in case of Glad/Mad/Sad approach.
        \item Best games: Speedboat, 5L's and Starfish
        \item Worst game: Glad/Mad/Sad
    \end{itemize}
    \item The game should be implemented permanently instead of standard procedures.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The participants definitely agree in case of implementing Starfish Game permanently.
        \item They have also a positive feeling in case of 5L's game in this field.
        \item The attendants of the experiment rather bow to statement "Agree" in case of Mood and Improvements.
        \item In case of Glad/Mad/Sad and Speedboat it was hard for them to decide.
        \item Best game: Starfish
        \item Worst game: Speedboat
    \end{itemize}
    \item The game might complement standard procedures.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item In case of complementing standard procedures with the introduced new approaches the Glad/Mad/Sad and 5L's had almost the same results.
        \item The result which equaled exactly "Agree" statement retrieved the Mood and Improvements approach.
        \item In case of Starfish they rather bow to "Agree" statement in case of complementing the standard procedure with the presented technique.
        \item In this category Speedboat has the worse result, it is hard for the participants to decide whether the approach should complement the standard procedures.
        \item Best game: 5L's
        \item Worst game: Speedboat
    \end{itemize}
    \item Thanks to the game the creativity of team members increased in the retrospective meeting.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The exact value of "Agree" statement and what is more the best result in this category is assigned to 5L's technique.
        \item The game creativity in Starfish, Mood and Improvements and Glad/Mad/Sad games is also influenced, but the results are below the "Agree" statement, but heavily above the "Hard to say" opinion.
        \item The worse result was assigned to Speedboat, for the participants it was hard to determine if the influence in the creativity happened. 
        \item Best game: 5L's
        \item Worst game: Speedboat
    \end{itemize}
    \item Thanks to the game the involvement of team members increased in the retrospective meeting.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Based on data collected from the feedback from the teams the 5L's game is the best in case of involvement of participants increment, slightly worse results performs Starfish technique.
        \item Both, Speedboat and Mood and Improvements are below "Agree" statement but significantly above the "Hard to say" opinion, so it is reasonable to claim that they likewise increasing the involvement.
        \item The Glad/Mad/Sad approach, accordingly to opinion of the team members, does not impact the involvement.
        \item Best game: 5L's
        \item Worst game: Glad/Mad/Sad
    \end{itemize}
    \item Thanks to the game the communication in the team increased in the retrospective meeting.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The best results achieved the 5L's game in case of increasing the communication in the team.
        \item Slightly below the "Agree" statement are placed the "Mood and Improvements" and "Speedboat" games, moreover we can assume positive influence in the team communication using these approaches. 
        \item On the Starfish technique has been decided, by the attendants of the research, that it's hard to indicate whether communication has been improved.
        \item In case of Glad/Mad/Sad game it has been established that it does not have influence on the communication increase. 
        \item Best game: 5L's
        \item Worst game: Glad/Mad/Sad
    \end{itemize}
    \item Thanks to the game the motivation of team members increased in the retrospective meeting.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The team was motivated and eager to participate especially using 5L's method. 
        \item In case of Starfish and Speedboat it has been decided that, even though the bar is slightly below the "Agree" statement, we can still establish that those methods increase teams' motivation. 
        \item For the Mood \& Improvements game, the participants determined that is hard for them to decide whether the motivation was increased using this technique.
        \item The Glad/Mad/Sad game, in case of motivating the team to be involved in the retrospective meeting, rather failed, but it is closer to the "Hard to say" statement, rather then "Disagree" opinion.
        \item Best game: 5L's
        \item Worst game: Glad/Mad/Sad
    \end{itemize}
    \item The game is easy to understand and play.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item In this category most of the games are above the "Agree" statement, which arises the conclusion that the Starfish, 5L's, Mood \& Improvements and Glad/Mad/Sad games were easy to understand by the attendants.
        \item Only one out of five approaches was for the participants hard to define whether it was easy or difficult to understand.
        \item Best game: Glad/Mad/Sad
        \item Worst game: Speedboat
    \end{itemize}

To conclude the feedback obtained from the participants, the presented \autoref{tab:groups-overallConclusion} indicates, how many times a game transpired to be the best and the worse. In summary, the best game for all the scenarios, on the basis of attendants of the experiment opinion, is 5L's, it works well in six out of eight categories. The worse technique turn out to be the Glad/Mad/Sad, probably because of the major similarity to the standard procedures. It is not said that the Glad/Mad/Sad approach should not be used or that all the retrospective meetings should implement the 5L's method. It is advised, based on our research, to vary in case of how the retrospective meeting is being led, different techniques being deployed provides more valuable results.
